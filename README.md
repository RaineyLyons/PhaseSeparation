# PhaseSeparation
A collection of code used in multiple projects all pertaining to phase separation in some way.

The current categories and relavent files are:

Ternary mixtures:

    -2DPhaseSeparationLongTimeEvap_v3: Simulates a pde system which models interaction of 3 particle species using a finite volume method. 
    -Correlation_StructureFactor_Functions: Contatins functions which approximate the characteristic lengths of morphologies using
                                            the correlation and structure factor functions. Best used with simulations from the above code.
